# tamilcanadianwalk.ca
This is a website created by me under the Canadian Tamil Congress
The purpose of the site is to inform the Tamil (and interested non-Tamil parties) about the annual fundraising walkathon held by the CTC
HTML, CSS, and JS were all used to create the front-end of the site
PHP and MongoDB were used to store contact information
Python was used to scrape data from the walkthon GoFundMe page and post all the donors on the TamilCanadianWalk site.
